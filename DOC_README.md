# Readme Documentation 

## Inline

For now the documentation is only inline: if you have to code something tricky, please explain **why** you're doing it (only a description is useless). And remember that the best way too have a maintainable code is to have a simple code !

## Doxygen

To generate the documentation, install `Doxygen` then go in the `doc` folder

    cd doc

and generate the documentation

    doxygen doxygen.conf
