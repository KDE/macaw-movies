## 1. Rules for coding

 - English is used for all names (class, function, variableâ€¦)
 - Abreviations are not tolerated anywhere in the code. All names must be as explicit as possible
 - class names start with a capital letter
 - members start with `m_`
 - local variables start with `l_`
 - function parameter names do not have a specific prefix
 - global variables are prohibited, the few accepted are capitalized
 - function names do not have a prefix, start with a lowercase character and use upper case characters for each new word (no underscore)
 - curly brackets always stand alone on new lines
 - if / else blocks always have curly brackets, even if only one call is to be done
 - blank line before calling return
 - blank line before two logical blocs
